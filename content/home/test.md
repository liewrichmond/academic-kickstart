Goodwill Computing Lab focuses on improving the operational efficiency and cost effectiveness of large-scale parallel computing systems by designing novel computational analytical tools and models to improve the scalability, reliability, and performance of HPC. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) posing unconventional questions and formulating hypothesis, (2) designing and conducting novel experiments to uncover new insights about large-scale HPC systems, and (3) validating our findings and techniques on real-systems and providing provable mathematical guarantees. 

We develop new analytical models, tools, and devised novel techniques that improve the reliability, power-efficiency, and resource-utilization of large-scale data-centric systems. Our techniques and tools benefit many large-scale data-intensive applications that produce, analyze, and manage terabytes of data per day on large supercomputers. We also enthusiastically apply resilience, high performance computing, and data analytics expertise to emerging inter-disciplinary research domains.

Goodwill Computing Lab also focuses on preparing next generation of students and educators to take advantage of parallel computing systems to solve problems of societal importance. The key to successfully realizing this vision is developing educational activities and material related to parallel computing and integrating the material at appropriate educational levels. To this end, we design and create new educational activities to train next generation of HPC researchers.
