abstract: "Large-scale parallel applications are highly data-intensive and perform terabytes of I/O routinely. Unfortunately, on a large-scale system where multiple applications run concurrently, I/O contention negatively affects system efficiency and causes unfair bandwidth allocation among applications. To address these challenges, this paper introduces GIFT, a principled dynamic approach to achieve fairness among competing applications and improve system efficiency."
