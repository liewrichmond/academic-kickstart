abstract: "As we approach exascale computing, large-scale HPC systems are becoming increasingly power-constrained, requiring them to run HPC workloads in an energy-efficient manner. The first step toward achieving this goal is to better understand, analyze, and quantify the power consumption characteristics of HPC jobs. However, there is a lack of understanding of the power consumption characteristics of HPC jobs which run on production HPC systems. Such characterization is required to guide the design of the next generation of power-aware resource management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first study to open-source the data and analysis of power-consumption characteristics of HPC jobs and users from two medium-scale production HPC clusters."
